1) How did viewing a diff between 2 version help you spot the bug ?
--> Show only diff, bloc by bloc

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
--> Quick comparison
--> Quick restore

--> - forget to commit

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
--> One change in a project may spend across several files

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
--> git log identifies the commits
--> git diff to see the changes
